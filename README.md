### Rules of the game

The game is called "Remember them"
The rules of the game are simple: ===> match all the animals before the game limit <===

- Click on the 'new game' button to shuffle the cards and start a new game.
- On each turn, a player turns over any two cards (one at a time) and if the cards match, they stay faced up (for instance, two lions).
- When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same position).
- Each turn counts as a move.
- The trick is to remember where the pairs are.
- The objective is to match the cards in less than 12 moves.

### The game is pretty simple and pretty fun

### Suitable for all ages!

### Enjoy :)
